Catchland is a swashy script typeface. 

Drawn and created by Mans Greback in 2021, this baseball lettering has a vivid personality and a soft, curly style. With the appearance of a hand-painted calligraphic illustration, the font works great for creating a truly professional graphic or logotype in a vintage form.

Use underscore _ to make a swash. Example: Brooklyn_
Use multiple underscores to make swashes of different lengths. 
Example: Dodgers________
